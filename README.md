# Heartbeat
Insanely simple heartbeat service that updates beats in file across systems. 
No need to create multiple servers for different healthchecks services or create different apischemas.
Simply start 1 server with autosearch for all relevant beat_* files and voila! you have a combined healthcheck server up and running.
